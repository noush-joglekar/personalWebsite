I took a class on Genomic Innovation this past semester, and we were evaluated on a group project. Recognizing that IBS and IBD are very real problems that plague millions of people with no immediate solution or respite, we proposed a lifestyle tracking system along with longitudinal microbiome sampling..
This is a quick and dirty r-shiny web app for Genomic Innovation class presentation. The idea is to track diet, symptoms, and microbiome composition of IBD patients so as to make predictions about potential flare-ups and make lifestyle recommendations

[A link](https://noush-joglekar.shinyapps.io/gi_final/) to the shiny app so you can play around with it
