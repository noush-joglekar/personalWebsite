I am a PhD candidate in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine program at Weill Cornell Medicine. I work in the neurogenetics department in Hagen Tilgner's lab, which focuses on alternative splicing signatures at the single cell level. I get very excited when people push the boundaries of what is known in science with new technology and math that seems to work like magic. Outside of science, I enjoy theater and all things literary, and occasionally indulge in the circus arts.

### Interests:
- Computational Biology
- Neuroscience
- Single-cell
- Transcriptomics
- Alternative splicing
