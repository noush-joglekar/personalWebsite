I recently started my postdoctoral position with with Gamze GÃ¼rsoy ([G2 Lab](https://g2lab.org/)) in the New York Genome Center ([NYGC](https://www.nygenome.org/)) and Columbia University [DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/). I am working on developing new algorithms to study the 3D structure of the genome, with the hope of parsing small and large-scale differences in the genome architecture of different cell types. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate degree at the Ohio State University, where I obtained my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in English. During my undergrad I dabbled in two main research projects, the first involving biophysical modeling of ischemic stroke, and the second involving statistical method development for outlier detection in cancer RNA-Seq data. Subsequently, I decided to pursue  a PhD in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine [program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) at Weill Cornell Medicine where I worked in the [Tilgner lab](https://www.tilgnerlab.com/). During my time there I focused on technology and algorithm development for studying alternative splicing in the brain at the single cell/single-nucleus level. 

While my interest in genomics has always been persistent,  I have realized over time that there are different ways of tackling questions related to the structural and molecular aspects of function. Long term, I want to use a combination of statistical and wet-lab approaches to comprehensively study how 1. the genome is organized, 2. what regulatory role the 3D genome plays on the transcriptional landscape of distinct cell types, and 3. how these molecular (transcriptional / epigenetic) signatures affect function. 

In general, I get very excited when people push the boundaries of what is known in science, particularly when a clever new technology is involved. Outside of science, I enjoy theater and all things literary, and occasionally indulge in the circus arts.
