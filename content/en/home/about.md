I am a computational biologist at [Immunai](https://www.immunai.com/), where I work as part of the the deep analytics
team to understand human immune response using a wealth of single-cell omics data. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate degree at the Ohio State University, where I obtained my B.S. in 
Applied Mathematics and B.A. in English. During my undergrad I dabbled in two main research projects, 
the first involving biophysical modeling of ischemic stroke, and the second involving statistical method 
development for outlier detection in cancer RNA-Seq data. 
Subsequently, I decided to pursue  a PhD in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine 
[program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) at Weill Cornell Medicine where I worked in the [Tilgner lab](https://www.tilgnerlab.com/). 
During my time there I focused on technology and algorithm development for studying alternative splicing in the brain 
at the single cell/single-nucleus level. I then did a short postdoc in the New York Genome Center ([NYGC](https://www.nygenome.org/)) and 
Columbia University [DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) where I develope algorithms to study how the 3D structure of the genome impacts
nuclear splicing in different cell types. 

While my interest in the omics has persisted, I have realized over time that there are different ways of 
tackling questions related to the structural and molecular aspects of function. Long term, I want to use the skills and intuition
I develop to contribute to understand how the human immune system works and contribute to translational medicine.

In general, I get very excited when people push the boundaries of what is known in science, 
particularly when a clever new technology is involved. Outside of science, I enjoy theater 
and all things literary, and occasionally indulge in the circus arts.
