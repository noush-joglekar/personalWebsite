      <description>A spatially resolved brain region- and cell type-specific isoform atlas of the postnatal mouse brain Abstract:
Splicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of regional variation is unclear. We present a single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions using single-cell long-read sequencing in mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests.</description>

      <description>Quick access to the scisorseqr GitHub page. I describe the workflow of the package and all code is included under the MIT license.
The vignette is hosted on a separate page of this website under Vignettes</description>

      <description>Exclusively spatial data pulled from the Nature Communications paper
Same shiny app as before except with full-length transcripts instead of exons. Also kept an SQLite backend so the server doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash.

      <description>Single-nuclei isoform RNA sequencing unlocks barcoded exon connectivity in frozen brain tissue Abstract:
Single-nuclei RNA sequencing characterizes cell types at the gene level. However, compared to single-cell approaches, many single-nuclei cDNAs are purely intronic, lack barcodes and hinder the study of isoforms. Here we present single-nuclei isoform RNA sequencing (SnISOr-Seq). Using microfluidics, PCR-based artifact removal, target enrichment and long-read sequencing, SnISOr-Seq increased barcoded, exon-spanning long reads 7.5-fold compared to naive long-read single-nuclei sequencing.</description>

      <description>I took a class on Genomic Innovation this past semester, and we were evaluated on a group project. Recognizing that IBS and IBD are very real problems that plague millions of people with no immediate solution or respite, we proposed a lifestyle tracking system along with longitudinal microbiome sampling.. This is a quick and dirty r-shiny web app for Genomic Innovation class presentation. The idea is to track diet, symptoms, and microbiome composition of IBD patients so as to make predictions about potential flare-ups and make lifestyle recommendations</description>

      <description>The scisorseqr package allows you to go from short-read, single cell assignments and a set of fastq files to a full-blown cell-type specific analysis of alternative splicing patterns.
Software required STARlong (and corresponding genome index file) Minimap2 if not using STARlong samtools bedtools python version &amp;gt;= 3.7 with the following libraries pandas multiprocessing Step 1: Barcode deconvolution The first step is to deconvolve barcodes from either the PacBio or ONT fastq output For that the user needs to specify</description>
